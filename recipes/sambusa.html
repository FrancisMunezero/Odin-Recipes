    <p>This sambusa recipe is my version of a Somali dish that I learned by watching friends around Ramadan. These sambusas are really good, and I can't stop eating them. They are served during Ramadan, weddings, parties, or just because!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onioin finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 lekk, washed and chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 punds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground  cardamom</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
           <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion, leek, and garlic; cook and stir until onion is transparent. Add ground beef; cook and stir until still slightly pink and about halfway done. Season with cumin, cardamom, salt, and pepper; mix well. Continue cooking until beef is browned and crumbly. Remove the skillet from heat. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Mix flour and water together in a small bowl to make a thin paste. Using one wrapper at a time, fold into the shape of a cone. Fill cone with beef mixture, close the top, and seal with paste. Repeat until wrappers or filling are used up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 365 degrees F (170 degrees C). There should be enough oil to submerge sambusas. Fry sambusas, a few at a time, in hot oil until golden brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li> 
        </ol>
